//! Edge finishing pipeline shared by the static [`scene`] and the
//! interactive [`route`] flowchart builders.
//!
//! Both builders hand their finished [`Scene`] to [`finish`], which
//! runs the same stages in a fixed order:
//!
//! 1. [`crate::ports::assign`]: distinct, ordered ports on every edge end.
//! 2. [`crate::router::repair`]: reroute edges that hit a node or frame
//!    or run on top of another edge.
//! 3. [`crate::ports::respace`]: space again the ends a reroute moved
//!    onto a side another edge already uses.
//! 4. [`crate::router::nudge`]: spread shared channels, merge stair
//!    steps and round corners (in the static scene, then put each side's
//!    ports in the order their paths head).
//! 5. [`crate::labels::relabel`]: re-place the labels of changed edges,
//!    and any label that covers something or sits on another stroke
//!    where a clearer spot exists.
//! 6. [`refit`]: grow the canvas over whatever the stages moved.
//!
//! The emit side adds the crossing gaps ([`crate::casing::masks`]).
//! Every stage reads the shared [`Ctx`] built once by [`ctx`]; the
//! helpers here are the vocabulary the stages share (end rects, sides,
//! flow axes).
//!
//! [`crate::scene::route_partial`] runs the same stages with some edges
//! *fixed* ([`Ctx::fixed`]): they keep the geometry they came with and
//! are only obstacles to the others, so a drag pays for the edges near
//! what moved, not for the whole drawing.
//!
//! [`scene`]: crate::scene::scene
//! [`route`]: crate::scene::route
