//! Back-edge lanes (report §2.2): the one rule for an edge that runs
//! against the flow, shared by the static layout
//! ([`crate::scene::scene`]), the layout's own estimate of what it will
//! draw (`layout::drawn_breadth`, which centres the drawing on it) and
//! [`crate::scene::route`], so the three agree on where such an edge
//! goes.
//!
//! Everything here is in flow coordinates: `b` across the flow, `l`
//! along it, growing downstream. A back-edge leaves its source (the
//! downstream end) by the side facing upstream and enters its target by
//! the side facing downstream. When nothing in the band between those
//! two sides stands in its way — adjacent layers, the return edge of a
//! 2-cycle, nodes between that lie off to one side ([`blocks_direct`]) —
//! it is drawn across the gap like a forward edge, a reversed S (no
//! lane). Otherwise it runs in an orthogonal lane, as mermaid
//! draws it: out of the source along its side's normal, across to the
//! lane, along the lane past everything in the band, across, and into
//! the target along its side's normal, so the arrowhead meets the side
//! square ([`corners`]). Only what reaches into the band is in its way
//! — the layers strictly between the ends, and anything on the ends'
//! own layers reaching [`LANE_REACH`] past the end's side (longer along
//! the flow than the end by twice that) — so the lane may run within an
//! end's own breadth, where it leaves or enters that end straight. The
//! lane keeps [`LANE_CLEAR`] plus half its label (the label rides the
//! lane, [`label_breadth`]) from what it passes, and takes the side
//! that costs the fewest crossings, then the shortest way round
//! ([`lane_at`]), never threading a gap between the nodes it passes.
//! Lanes are planned innermost first (the shortest band), each planned
//! lane an obstacle to the later ones whose band it shares, so nested
//! lanes never run on top of each other ([`plan`]).
